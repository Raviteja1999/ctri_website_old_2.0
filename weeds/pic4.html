<div style="display:block;text align:left"<br><font size="4">Of the several species of Euphoribia occurring in the plains E. hirta, is the one most widely distributed and commonly met with.  It is hardy, rather deep rooted annual with plenty of milk juice in all it parts. Branches are few, sub-erect, erect, or ascending and attaining a height of a foot or more.  The stem is round and covered with yellow crisp hairs ; it is usually solitary and bent backwards at the top in a characteristic way.  Leaves are simple, opposite, shortly stalked, with very small linear stipules.  The blade is obliquely oblong-lanceolate, acute and the margin is closely serrate.  The flowers are unisexual and both the male and female ones are found in the same involucres.  These involucres are collected in dense axillary or terminal congested cymes.</font>
